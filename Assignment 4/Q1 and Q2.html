    <!-----Q1 Describe the main differences between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS  Grid 
    layout model ?
    
    
    Flexbox- flexbox is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, focusing, on distributing space and aligning items along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically). Itâ€™s best suited for layouts where you have a row or column of items  such as navigation menus,card-based 
    Designs, or centering content within a container. 
    
    CSS Grid- Css Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to define both rows and columns. It creates a grid of cells where context can be placed in any cell or span 
    Across multiple cells. CSS Grid is ideal for complex grid-based designs like magazine layouts, forms, and any layout where content needs to be placed in a precise grid structure.
    
    
    
    
    Q2 Explain the  role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout model
    
    justify-content : The justify-content property in flexbox is used to control the alignment of flex items along the main axis of the flex container. It determines how the extra space or insufficient space along the main axis is distributed. There are several value for justify-content, including flex start, flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-evenly and space-around.
    
    
    align-items : The align-item property controls the alignment of flex items along the cross axis of the container. It specifies how items are positioned within their container along this axis. It accepts values such as flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, and stretch
        
    
    Gap:The gap property is used to define the space between flex items in both directions, both along the main axis and the across axis. Itâ€™s often applied to the flex container itself. It simplifies spacing and creates consistent gaps between items without needing to apply margins to individual items.
       
    Flex-direction: The flex-direction property determine the direction in which flex items are placed within the flex container. It define the main axis and consequently, the layout flow. It can have values such as row, row-reverse, column, or column-reverse.
    
    Flex-wrap: the flex-wrap property controls whether flex items are allowed to wrap onto multiple line with in the flex container when they dont fit along the main axis. It accepts values like nowrap, wrap and wrap-reverse.
